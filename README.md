### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Atharva! Thanks for checking out my GitHub Profile. Please visit [my portfolio](https://www.atharvacodes.ml/) for a more detailed look into my projects.

I'm currently doing a masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence with a specialisation in NLP at Queen Mary, University of London. I did my bachelor's in Computer Science at Durham University and graduated with a Class I Honours in summer of 2022.

Aside from a general interest in NLP, my main research interests are knowledge graphs and (contextual) representation of entities.

Please [email](mainto:atharvatidke80@gmail.com) or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atharvat80/) if you'd like to get in touch!.
